        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.

    <p class="intro_copy">
      Our goal at camp, is to limit worldy distractions, focus on God, and study the Bible together. Our campers tell us that reducing wordly influences is one of greatest benefits of attending camp.
    </p>

    <p class="intro_copy">
      While at camp, campers stay busy attending bible classes, athletic events, activity classes, special programs, and free-time with their peers.
    </p>

    <h1 class="intro_subtitle">Our campers travel from all over.</h1>

    <p class="intro_copy">
      For the past 20 years we have met in Toledo, Ohio, however our campers come from all over the country! This gives campers the unique opportuntiy to build friendships with their peers outside their normal social circles. Many of these friendships continue on after camp ends and many continue for life.
    </p>

    <h1 class="intro_subtitle">Experienced and friendly staff.</h1>

    <p class="intro_copy">
      We've been around 25 years thanks to the dedication and support of our amazing staff! Our leadership, counselors, and staff are an amazing group of men and women who volunteer their time in order to provide a safe, fun, and enriching environment for our campers.

        "I have been a counselor at Camp N.O.A.H. for 13 years. What a difference a week makes at Camp N.O.A.H. I have witnessed friendships and relationships begin and thrive at Camp N.O.A.H. that I know will last a lifetime and into eternity. When friendships, athletic camaraderie, fun activities, and great meals are centered around the Word of God, it makes for a beautiful, memorable week. Camp N.O.A.H. will be an influence for good for the rest of your life - “it’s the place to be.”
